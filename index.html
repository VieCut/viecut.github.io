		  <h2>Overview</h2>
The minimum cut problem for an undirected edge-weighted graph asks us to divide its set of nodes into two blocks while minimizing the weight sum of the cut edges. It is a fundamental graph problem with many applications in different fields, such as network reliability, where assuming equal failure probability edges, the smallest edge cut in the network has the highest chance to disconnect the network; in VLSI design, where the minimum cut can be used to minimize the number of connections between microprocessor blocks; and as a subproblem in branch-and-cut algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other combinatorial problems.

<br>
<br>

  VieCut - <a href="#" style="color:red">Vie</a>nna Minimum <a href="#" style="color:red">Cut</a>s -- is a shared-memory parallel heuristic algorithm for the minimum cut problem. Based on the algorithm we also present a fast and exact shared-memory parallel algorithm for the minimum cut problem.

  We provide it here as easy to use open source software.
  The algorithm is based on the label propagation algorithm, the contraction tests of Padberg and Rinaldi and the minimum cut algorithm of Nagamochi et al. and computes minimum cuts of huge networks fast and with use of shared-memory parallelism. While VieCut can not guarantee solution quality, in practice the algorithm outputs better cuts than other inexact algorithms in significantly lower time, especially when using shared-memory parallelism. This codebase also includes a fast and exact shared-memory parallel based on VieCut and the algorithm of Nagamochi et al. Using the high-quality cuts given by VieCut the algorithm can detect and contract contractible edges fast and in parallel. Using these techniques we can compute exact minimum cuts significantly faster than the state of the art, sometimes with speedups of more than an order of magnitude.
                       
                        <br><br>

Additionally we give a branch-and-reduce algorithm for the multiterminal cut problem. 
The multiterminal cut problem is the NP-hard generalization of the minimum s-t-cut problem to more than two terminal vertices.
Our algorithm combines a multitude of kernelization routines with a sophisticated branching routine and is able to solve this problem on some very large instances.
Even if the algorithm is not able to guarantee optimality of its solution in a problem, it gives a high-quality approximation.
